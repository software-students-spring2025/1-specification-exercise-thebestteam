See instructions. Delete this line and replace with the name(s) of the stakeholder(s) you interviewed and lists showing their goals/needs, and problems/frustrations.

### Stakeholder 1: Shemar Forbes 

Goals/needs: 
- hope to have a good professor 
- needs to be a good class fit 
- likes classes with groups 
- lean more towards group work itself for meeting new people 
- it would be nice to have people that you know 
- get into a class that works for the schedule, but instead of a number one choice he is searching for a second or third choice 
- searching for second or third choice ruins the experience for him 

Problems/frustrations: 
- Albert itself should have a split screen view 
- more student centric 
- not realizing how many classes you may have is an issue 
- filled up classes 
- inconveninet times for classes 
- more clarity regarding being on the waitlist 
- there is a cap on the waitlist 
- the current system doesn't do much to help those on the waitlist 
- advisors aren't very helpful 
- feels like a waste of money
- wanting some satisfaction from the course selections 

### Stakeholder 2: Alex Li

Goals/needs: 
- Wants to take cross-school class
- Check popularity of course (how fast it fills up)
- Check reviews of class (include ratings)

Problems/frustrations: 
- Process of applying for cross-school class is very convoluted and can mess up enrollment for other classes.
- Be able to see class schedule while browsing courses.
- Didn't check availability repeatedly so if someone dropped it he wouldn't know.

## Product Vision Statement

ClassBay (like ebay but for classes) is a service that revamps class signups and waitlists with a secondary marketplace for course registration, providing course liquidity by allowing students to exchange spots during the add-drop period making a stressful process streamlined and leading to better matchups through social dynamics and free market principles. 

## User Requirements

As a student, I want to easily view and join waitlists for full classes so that I can secure a spot if one becomes available.

As a student, I want to be able to sell my spot in a class so that I can manage my schedule more flexibly and recover some of my tuition costs.

As a student, I want to receive notifications when a spot in a desired class opens up so that I can register before it fills up again.

As an administrator, I want to view real-time statistics on class demand and waitlist lengths so that I can adjust course offerings accordingly.

As a student, I want to filter and search for classes by times, professors, and availability so that I can find courses that best fit my academic and personal schedule.

As a student that is graduating soon, I am looking for a class that can prepare me for the workforce so that I feel ready. 

As a customer, I want to sign up so I can start placing orders.

As a college student graduating soon, I want get into a class that is practical so that I can be prepared for the workforce. 

As a college student looking into classes, I want to switch to classes that fit my needs so that I can take classes that are more balanced to handle the semester. 

As a college student looking into signing up for classes, I want to sign up for classes with some people that I am familiar with so that I feel that I know some people in class and projects.

As a student, I want to be able to see historical course data (Stored in Course Feedback Results) on the course search page to help with enrollment decisions.
